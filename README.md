# Geo Discussion Forum
Welcome to the Geo Discussion Forum project! This project aims to create a web-based 
discussion forum for users to share and discuss geographic information and maps. 
The forum is built using Geoserver, an open-source server that allows for the publishing, viewing, 
and editing of geographic information.
